                Dex controller is designed for the turtlebot3 and allows the robot to follow a path using a regulated pursuit controller, with a few extra features:
                
                Path Alignment:
                    Upon receiving a new path, the controller first performs an in-place rotation to align itself with the 
                    beginning of the path before initiating any forward movement.
                Goal Orientation:
                    As the robot approaches the final point of the path, the controller ensures that it matches the desired 
                    goal orientation by performing an in-place rotation.

                Obstacle Ignorance:
                    The controller detects if obstacles are in front of it and stops if it is unable to move forward.
